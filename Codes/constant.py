"Cross_correlation": """ ### On asymmetric relations and robustified cross-correlation approach to surveillance based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Chile and Peru

We conduct statistical analysis of correlations for pre-alert system of the infection in population by wastewater screening of SARS-CoV-2 genomic fragments using qRT-PCR. We analyze data on surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as an epidemiological tool to anticipate outbreaks in Chile and Peru. We found there exists a positive relationship between genomic copies in wastewater and reported cases, and the relationship is of probabilistic nature.

"Cluster_Classification": """ ### Enhancing the Application and Mathematical Explanation of Classification and Clustering Models.

This project centers on the practical utilization and mathematical explication of six classification algorithms and five clustering models. These classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, LinearSVC, XGBClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier, are assessed using metrics such as Accuracy and F1-Score. 

The clustering models, encompassing K-Means, GMM, K-Medoids, Agglomerative Hierarchy, and Birch, are evaluated using metrics like Silhouette Score and Calinski-Harabasz Score. The core objective of the research is to provide a mathematical understanding of these machine learning techniques in a real dataset.

"Hand_Gesture": """ ### Sign Language Prediction Model using YoloV8 and OpenCV.

This project involves the implementation of a real-time sign language detection model using the YOLOv8 pretrained model. The project's primary objective is to develop a model capable of predicting 9 letters of sign language based on this pretrained model.

To facilitate data acquisition, a concise code snippet for capturing and saving photos in a designated directory is employed. The training process takes place in Google Colab through Roboflow.

Furthermore, it offers a user-friendly experience through the integration of the OpenCV2 library in Python 3.10 for real-time monitoring of hand and body detection.
